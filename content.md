**KF94** is a South Korean general-public mask standard. Most KF94 masks feature a boat-style design and attach to the face using ear loops. The "KF" stands for "**K**orea **F**ilter."

KF94 masks are certified by the Korean government in a manner similar to how the US-based NIOSH certifies N95 respirators.
